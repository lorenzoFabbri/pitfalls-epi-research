# Pitfalls in Epidemiological Research

The idea of this repository is to collect in a centralised manner common and less common pitfalls in epidemiological research, and eventually ways to avoid or fix them.

New sections and sub-sections can be added. For ease of reference, new entries should be added in a tidy way as new points (I love lists). Please include what the pitfall is, eventual references (please include a link to the paper), possible solutions, and anything else of relevance. Feel free to include your name and social details (e.g., Bluesky), or not!
