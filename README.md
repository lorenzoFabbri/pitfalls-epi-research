# Pitfalls in Epidemiological Research

The idea of this repository is to collect in a centralised manner common and less common pitfalls in epidemiological research, and eventually ways to avoid or fix them.

New sections and sub-sections can be added. For ease of reference, new entries should be added in a tidy way as new points (I love lists). Please include what the pitfall is, eventual references (please include a link to the paper), possible solutions, and anything else of relevance. Feel free to include your name and social details (e.g., Bluesky), or not!

Template:

- [What is the **pitfall**?]. [Is there a reference?]. [Are there **ways** to avoid it or ways to fix it?]. [Who are you?]

Some pitfalls:

- Use of ratios as dependent or independent variables in a regression model.
- Standardization of biomarkers of exposure by creatinine levels.
- Use of p-values to select confounders.
